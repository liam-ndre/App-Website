          <h2>We Built EcoBoi for the World</h2>
          <p>We'd like the task of 'lessening the damage' to not look so daunting and to be almost seemless. We want you to have saving the environment look almost as easy as breathing.</p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Ecoboi is about our drive for the love of the environment. We’re a young team with big ambitions, taking small steps. Our vision to reach such a goal lay behind the foundation of this application. I hope you can see that vision through our application :)</p>

          <h3>Liam Eguia</h3>
          <p>Liam was responsible for the design of the website as well as writing this About Us Page. So you’ll definitely see some bias here. <i>Cough, cough</i> he’s first on this list. <i>Cough, cough</i> he’s the best :)</p>

          <h3>Patricija Shalkauskaite</h3>
          <p>Ever wonder how our mascots became this cute? Well, we can thank our Director of Illustrations for that. She’s responsible for the physical creation of ELI and SID and you can clearly tell that they’re happy to be here, despite the current conditions of this earth. Any illustrations you see are under her responsibility. Working alongside Liam, she too helped with the css of this website.</p>

            <h3>Lukas Balog</h3>
            <p> A home page has a few seconds to grab your attention. What makes it eye-catching? The visuals? The play on words? Well, Lukas sure knew the question and he supplied the answers. Any content on the home page and anything that you like about it was due to Lukas’ input.</p>

            <p>If you’re wondering who did the “why” and what were they thinking, Leona’s the one to answer for it. Her persuasion skills are put to the test on that page. Though creative writing doesn’t come naturally to her, she can make some pretty punny arguments!</p>

            <p>The design team put extra thought behind the user interface of the app design. Ever wonder how our early design has the app’s interface within a short period of time? Well, Bartosz is your main man behind it. </p>
